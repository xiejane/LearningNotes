Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) or unexpected behavior in your code.

Bugs can result for many reasons:
- Errors in your design or implementation
- Android framework limitations (or bugs)
- Missing requirements or assumptions for how the app should work
- Device limitations (or bugs)
